               </hints>
               <lesson>Theres also another type of print: System.out.println(). While System.out.print() prints the input on the same line, System.out.println() prints the given input and moves to a new line so that any new input will begin in the next line. Lets try it out!

               </hints>
               <lesson>In any programming language, a variable is used to hold values for later use. For example, the statement 'String x = "Hello";' stores the text 'Hello' as x in your program, which can then be used in subsequent code. Lets use our knowledge from the previous tasks to print out a String Variable!

               </hints>
               <lesson>Integer is another variable like String which, instead of storing text, is used to keep integer values. For example, The assignment 'int x = 5' creates a variable x with the value 5. Integers are numbers and you can therefore perform mathematical operations on them. Taking our previously declared variable x, we can add 5 to x and store the result within a new Integer variable like so: 'int y = x + 5;'. The value of y is now 10 as x was declared with a value of 5.</lesson>

               <lesson>Conditional statements are used to execute different code based on whether a given expression evaluates to true or false. A boolean variable may be used to express true or false. You may do so by setting a variable using the following format: 

	boolean myBoolean = true; 

 You can construct an if statement by using the following syntax. The code within the 'if' block will execute if myBoolean is true. The code within the 'else' block will run if myBoolean is false. 

	if (myBoolean) {
		// your code
	}
	else {

               <lesson>Along with 'if' and 'else' statements, there is also the 'else if' statement. Using these statements, there are more possibilities to branch code off of than simple true or false.
Relational operators to be used in an expression include the following: less than (&lt;), greater than (&gt;), less than or equal to (&lt;=), greater than or equal to (&gt;=), equals (==), or not equals (!=)</lesson>

               <lesson>While loops are used to execute code numerous times while a given expression or value evaluates to true. You can construct a while statement by using the following syntax. The code within the 'while' block will execute so long as myBoolean is true. 

	while (myBoolean) {
		// your code
	}. 
It is very important to be careful when using loops, as infinitely executing loops will likely cause problems for a program. As such, it is important to make sure that any variables within a while statement are being updated as needed within the while block.</lesson>

               <lesson>For loops are used to execute code for a number of times while a temporary variable is within a certain range. You can construct a for statement by using the following syntax. The code within the 'for' block will execute so long as the variable defined within the statement evaluates to true based on the given expression. The third expression of the for statement updates the variable after each iteration.

               <lesson>An array is a list of variables of fixed length. For example, a list of ten integers can be defined with the following code:
	int a[] = new int[10];
To access a value in the list, the indexes begin counting at 0 and continue to the length of the list minus 1. As such, the first element of array a is a[0] and the last element is a[9]. To get the length of an array, use a.length to get the value 10.</lesson>
